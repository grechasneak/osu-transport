# Focus

I dream of seeing a world powered by nuclear energy.  To that end, I have decided to focus on nuclear security and safeguards in order to help advance my dream


I work under Todd Palmer, and I am currently working on a project to help develop safeguards for small modular reactors for Idaho National Laboratory.
